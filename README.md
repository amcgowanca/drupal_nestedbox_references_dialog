## Drupal NestedBox References Dialog

Enables basic integration of NestedBox with the References Dialog contributed module. The NestedBox's primary implementation purpose is to be used with the Inline Entity Form module, however, in the event that you find yourself needing to use the NestedBox entities with References Dialog like I did, the implementation here will allow that.
